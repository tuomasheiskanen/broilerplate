broilerplate
============

A rough boilerplate for quickly starting up a web project. Uses Gulp for building and Node for serving.

Features:
 * Jade preprocessing
 * Stylus preprocessing
 * Watch/monitor changes and compile
 * Livereload changes to browser
 * Validate JavaScript with JSHint - Stylish reporter too :)
 * Isolate source from build product
 * Separate configurations for different environments

TODO:
 * Testing support (karma/jasmine)
 * Heroku deployment
 * Editor configuration file
 * Autoreload server files (nodemon?)
